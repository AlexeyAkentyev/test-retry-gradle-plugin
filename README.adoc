= Test Retry Gradle Plugin

toc::[]

A standalone (i.e. not part of Gradle Enterprise) Gradle plugin that augments Gradle’s built-in Test task with the ability to retry tests that have failed for the purpose of mitigating test flakiness.

== Configuring

The plugin will decorate each `Test` task with an extension. Any all-build or cross-task configuration is achieved via Gradle’s existing constructs (e.g. `tasks.withType()`, `allprojects {}`).

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'org.gradle.test-retry' version 'VERSION'
}

test {
    retry {
        maxRetries = N <1>
        maxFailures = N <2>
    }
}
----
<1> Max number of times to retry. A value of 0 effectively disables retrying.
<2> After this many discrete failed tests, stop retrying failures

== Retry mechanics

The retry mechanism is conceptually analogous to re-running the task again but using test selection (e.g. `--tests`) to select only the tests that failed. That is, all tests are executed, then the failed tests are retried. The (hopefully reducing) set of failed tests continues to be retried until there are no failures left, or `maxRetries`/`maxFailures` is reached.

The `maxRetries`/`maxFailures` properties define thresholds for how many failed tests are allowed before retry is disabled. This is intended to be used to avoid the overhead of retrying when there is a catastrophic failure causing many tests to fail (e.g. problem in a test base class, database dependency unavailable), with the assumption that they would just fail again on further retry.

=== Parameterized tests

In a few cases, test selection for testing frameworks limits the granularity at which tests can be retried. In each case, this plugin retries at worst at method level. For JUnit5 `@ParameterizedTest`, TestNG `@Test(dataProvider = "...")`, and Spock `@Unroll` tests the plugin will retry the entire method with all parameters including those that initially passed.

=== Test dependencies

The plugin supports retrying Spock `@Stepwise` tests and TestNG `@Test(dependsOn = { … })` tests.

* Upstream tests (those that the failed test depends on) are run because the flaky test may depend on state from the prior execution of an upstream test.
* Downstream tests are run because a flaky test causes any downstream tests to be skipped in the initial test run.

== Effect on Reporting

The approach to reporting is to simply report each execution discretely, as opposed to inventing some kind of aggregate outcome. Each execution of a retried test will be reported. This has the least effect on test reporters in other tools like IDEs and continuous integration environments that expect one of a set of previously known outcomes for each test.


=== In Gradle build scans

Gradle build scans show each invocation of a test with its outcome:

=== In IDEs

The plugin has been tested with link:url[Idea, https://www.jetbrains.com/idea], link:url[Eclipse IDE, https://www.eclipse.org] and link:url[Netbeans, https://www.netbeans.org]. For Idea and Eclipse each test execution delegated to Gradle is reported discretely as we do for the test reports.

==== Idea

Running tests with no Gradle delegation causes tests to not be retried, as expected.

==== Eclipse

Running tests with no Gradle delegation causes tests to not be retried, as expected.

==== Netbeans
Netbeans only shows the last execution of a test.

=== On CI servers

The plugin has been tested with the reporting of link:url[TeamCity, https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity] and link:url[Jenkins, https://www.jenkins.io].

==== TeamCity
Flaky tests (tests being executed multiple times but with different results) are detected by TeamCity and marked as flaky.
TeamCity lists each test that was executed and how often it was run in the build.

==== Jenkins

Jenkins reports each test execution discretely as expected.

== Developing

Release by running `./gradlew final` which will automatically select the next minor release version, tag the repository, publish the binary to Bintray, and publish the plugin to the Gradle plugin portal. To perform a major version release, `./gradlew final -Prelease.scope=major`. To release a patch, `./gradlew final -Prelease.scope=patch`.

When adding new source files, run `./gradlew lF` to automatically add license headers.
